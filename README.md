## Assignment 1 (DevOps)

### Q:1 Agile VS DevOps

`DevOps` is a culture that promotes collaboration between Development and Operations Team. This allows deploying code to production faster and in an automated way. It helps to increases an organization’s speed to deliver application and services. It can be defined as an alignment of development and IT. It focuses on communication, integration, and collaboration among IT professionals to enables rapid deployment of products.

`Agile` Agile Methodology involves continuous iteration of development and testing in the SDLC process. This software development method emphasizes on iterative, incremental, and evolutionary development.

`DevOps focuses on constant testing and delivery while the Agile process focuses on constant changes.`

### Q:2 Define CI, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment

#### Continuous integration (CI)

`Continuous Integration (CI)` is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. It’s a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests then run.

#### Continuous Delivery (CD)

`Continuous Delivery` is an approach where teams release quality products frequently and predictably from source code repository to production in an automated fashion. It is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage.

#### Continuous Deployment (CD)

`Continuous Deployment (CD)` is a software release process that uses automated testing to validate if changes to a codebase are correct and stable for immediate autonomous deployment to a production environment. Delivery is the precursor to deployment. In delivery, there is a final manual approval step before production release.

### Q:4 Difference b/w Git & Github

 `Git` is a open source distributed version control software that tracks the changes in files. In Git, we can keep track of the files in something called a repository or repo. We can use the Git commands on the command line or GUI to manage your repo.

 `Github` on the other hand is not software, it's a platform. It is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It offers all of Git’s DVCS SCM and has some additional features. This includes collaboration functionality like project management, support ticket management, and bug tracking. With GitHub, developers can share their repositories, access other developers’ repositories, and store remote copies of repositories to serve as backups.

 ### Q:5 Stages of Git

 Git has three main states that your files can reside in
 
  - Modified
  - Staged
  - Committed
 
 `Modified` means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet. `Staged` means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot. `Committed` means that the data is safely stored in your local database.
