## Assignment 1 (DevOps)

### Q:1 Agile VS DevOps

`DevOps` is a culture that promotes collaboration between Development and Operations Team. This allows deploying code to production faster and in an automated way. It helps to increases an organization’s speed to deliver application and services. It can be defined as an alignment of development and IT. It focuses on communication, integration, and collaboration among IT professionals to enables rapid deployment of products.

`Agile` Agile Methodology involves continuous iteration of development and testing in the SDLC process. This software development method emphasizes on iterative, incremental, and evolutionary development.

`DevOps focuses on constant testing and delivery while the Agile process focuses on constant changes.`

### Q:2 Define CI, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment

#### Continuous integration (CI)

`Continuous Integration (CI)` is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. It’s a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests then run.

#### Continuous Delivery (CD)

`Continuous Delivery` is an approach where teams release quality products frequently and predictably from source code repository to production in an automated fashion. It is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage.

#### Continuous Deployment (CD)

`Continuous Deployment (CD)` is a software release process that uses automated testing to validate if changes to a codebase are correct and stable for immediate autonomous deployment to a production environment. Delivery is the precursor to deployment. In delivery, there is a final manual approval step before production release.
